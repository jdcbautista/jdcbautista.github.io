<p >Hi! My name is Julius & I'm passionate about logic & design. I graduated <a href="https://codeplatoon.org">Code Platoon</a> back in February of 2021, where we learned how to write full stack web applications in python and javascript utilizing frameworks like Django and React.</p>

<p>
Something I've been asked a lot recently is "What made you decide to start learning code?"<br>
The simple answer is, the opportunity just presented itself through the VA's VET TEC program launching in 2020, and I couldn't pass it up.  I'd already been dabbling with C# and Python in recent years, and my friends in tech encouraged me to commit.

<!-- I researched several coding camps and ultimately settled with Code Platoon, who I found to be more authentic, supportive, and empowering than the rest. -->

<!-- I'm an open book but I don't usually talk about myself unprompted.  Identity really is an elusive thing, little more than a story, or a brand.  I prefer to bring such stories to life organically by interacting with others.  <br><br>

But since I am searching for employment, I will do my best to bring my story to life.  After all, I've fallen in love with the culture as well the workflow, and we all make sacrifices in the name of love.<br><br>

At the moment (5.24) I've only got videos to two of my projects on this gitHub page.  I started building a React based web portfolio.  My domain will take another week to finish transferring to Google from Namecheap, but it should redirect to a working URL.  Feel free to shoot me an email (jdcbautista@gmail.com) if it's not.<br><br> -->
